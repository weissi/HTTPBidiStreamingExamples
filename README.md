# HTTPBidiStreaming

Examples of bidirectional HTTP/1.1 streaming. The examples are all combinations of the following clients/servers:

Clients:
  - [AsyncHTTPClient](https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client.git)
  - URLSession

Servers:
- [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio.git)
- [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor.git)

This repository mainly exists as an example for bug reports in the low-level HTTP stacks.
